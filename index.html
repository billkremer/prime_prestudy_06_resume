<!-- What to do:
Enhance your resume with however you see fit based off what you learned this week. Keep a log of changes that you made that will help support your written portion of this assignment.
Recommit your work to GitHub Pages so that I can review what you have completed.
Email us a summary of what you changed about your resume styling and presentation. In talking about what you changed, make sure to talk about what things might have been 'new learnings' for you and why you decided to integrate them into your existing resume.--> 


<!-- optional
Get rid of those Divs!
Divs are awesome. We use them a ton once we get into adding functionality to our web experiences. But some developers use them excessively. Your task is to replace every Div you have in your resume with any of the new tags you learned about.
NOTE: There might be reasons why you can't eliminate all of them, the goal here is to think critically about what NEEDS to be a Div, versus what can be something else.
Once you are complete, post your work to GitHub Pages and email your instructors.

<!-- RESUME RE-RE-CHALLENGE

Lets take one more crack at that Resume. This time, hide the entire resume. Then, using a button, reveal the resume using jQuery. Additionally, push the styling of the resume with all the new crazy CSS you just learned!

This time, instead of checking it into GitHub pages, lets check it into a new repo called "prime_prestudy_06_resume". -->
